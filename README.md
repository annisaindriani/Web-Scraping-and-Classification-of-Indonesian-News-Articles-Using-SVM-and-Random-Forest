# Web Scraping and Classification of Indonesian News Articles Using Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest
## Description
This project focuses on gathering Indonesian news text data through web scraping, resulting in a total of 480 news articles sourced from digital media outlets such as detik.com, ANTARA News, and Portal Media. The articles span several categories, including politics, sports, business, and entertainment. A comprehensive text preprocessing pipeline was implemented, which included cleansing, tokenization, filtering, and lemmatization to prepare the data for analysis.

Subsequently, data visualization techniques and word clouds were created to provide insights into the text data. Text representation was performed using two methods: TF-IDF and Word2Vec. The classification modeling of the news articles was executed using two machine learning algorithms, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest, with parameter tuning applied to optimize model performance. This project aims to enhance understanding and classification of news content within the specified categories.
